# Surveillance and Motion Sensor Alert System

## Aim
To design and simulate a Surveillance and Motion Sensor Alert System using Cisco Packet Tracer that detects motion within a secured area and promptly notifies the user through the connected network, thereby enhancing security monitoring and automated alerting mechanisms.

## Problem Statement
Security breaches and unauthorized access are major concerns in homes, offices, and industries. Traditional surveillance systems often require manual monitoring, making them less effective in providing real-time alerts. Hence, there is a need to design an automated motion detection and alert system that integrates with surveillance infrastructure. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, this project simulates a system where motion sensors detect unusual activity and immediately notify the user via alerts, ensuring faster response and improved safety.


## Scope of the Solution
- The project focuses on simulating **IoT-based surveillance** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- Provides a **cost-effective simulation** instead of real hardware implementation.  
- Demonstrates **real-time motion detection and notification** system.  
- Can be extended to include **multiple sensors, cameras, and smart home devices**.  
- Useful for **homes, offices, banks, industries, and other secured environments** where constant monitoring is required.  
- Forms the basis for building **scalable smart surveillance systems** in the future.

## Required Components
### Software
- **Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT)** – for simulating the network and IoT devices.  

### Hardware (simulated in CPT)
- **Motion Sensor** – to detect movement in the secured area.  
- **Home Gateway / IoT Gateway** – to connect IoT devices to the network.  
- **PC / Laptop** – to configure devices and receive notifications.  
- **Smartphone / Tablet (simulated)** – as a user interface to receive alerts.

## Result
The system was successfully implemented and simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer. When motion was detected by the sensor, an automatic alert notification was generated and sent to the user through the configured network. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using IoT-based surveillance with motion detection for real-time security monitoring and user notification.
